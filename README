sync_akonadi_palm_birthday - Copies birthday custom field on palm to akonadi

Unfourtunately in recent KDE4 versions of kpilot it is not longer possible to
copy the birthday information stored custom field on the palm handheld
automatically on hotsync, see
https://www.georglutz.de/blog/archives/102-Contacts-sync-problems-with-kpilot-in-KDE4.html.

Fourtunately all the adressbook information from palm handheld is stored in the
VCARD information on KDE/akonadi in special X-Field like
<code>X-KPILOT-CUSTOM0</code>.

This script now parses the pilot custom field in the akonadi VCARD and adds an
addionatl BDAY header there. BDAY is the offical data field for VCARDs for
borthday information.

To do so it writes directly to the local mysql database akonadi is currently
using. This is just a quick'n dirty solution. Of course it would be much
cleaner to use the akonadi interface. Use this script at your own risk, you
have be warned. At least make sure that no other application is writing to
akonadi at the same time.

The shell script akonadi_test_mirror.sh is meant as test import real live data
into a local test database to check in advance that nothing goes wrong.
